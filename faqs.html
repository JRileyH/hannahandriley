Riley and I will be mildly dressed up (think suit and tie for Riley and luxe pant suit or jumper for Hannah). But the after hang will be at a random bar so if you're not family, no need to dress up (but feel free to join us in dressing up if you so wish!). 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Upstate, there is a pool on the grounds (might be too cold to swim though), bikes to rent, and we will be hanging outside a lot so pack some good outdoor clothing (especially some warm clothing because it gets cool at night)! 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The rail explorers will happen rain or shine so bring a rain jacket. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            And if you are driving upstate and have a camp chair you can bring with you, please do! There's a bonfire outside each night with some chairs and we'll have some foldable chairs, but your own camp chair might be more comfortable :)</div>

We appreciate you traveling and spending the weekend with us. Breakfast is provided by the hotel, lunch and dinner will be catered, and we will be providing snacks and water/seltzer/some soda, as well as beer/cider/hard seltzer in the evenings. But if there's anything else you'd like to bring for yourselves, feel free!</div>

Every activity is optional; you're welcome to get dinner/lunch somewhere else if you wish on Friday and Saturday, or do something other than the rail explorers on Saturday afternoon. On Saturday night we are planning to do a fun trivia/newlywed game night, so that might be the best thing to attend with everyone out of all the events/dinners! We just wanted to get everyone together in the same place to hang and celebrate :) There will be tents and tables outside for night gatherings (weather permitting). There is also a small "den" area on site that seats 15~ people that can be an indoor hang out place as well. Hopefully it's a nice relaxing getaway for y'all!</div>

          <div id="w-node-_2b1c1233-b023-44b9-d142-653288efeacb-2d575b4a" class="answer">Easiest way is to drive. If you're in the city, it's about a 2.5 hour trip. There is parking onsite for you at The Graham &amp; Co.
            <br/> 
            <br/> 
            If you're coming from NYC and not driving/car pooling, I'd recommend taking a <a href="https://trailways.com/schedules/bus-from-new-york-ny-to-phoenicia-ny/" target="_blank">Trailway</a> bus from the Port Authority in NYC directly to Phoenicia (about 3 hour transit time, $40 one way trip, and drops you off a 4 minute walk away from The Graham &amp; Co). Or you can take the Metro-North to Poughkeepsie and get a taxi from Poughkeepsie to Phoenicia (about $250 one way trip depending on taxi prices, 3 hours transit time (2 hours train, 1 hour taxi). 
           <br/>
            <br/> 
          If you are flying in, I'd check flight prices into the city (JFK/LGA/EWR), because the closest airport to Phoenicia is technically Stewarts (SWF), and it might be more expensive to fly into SWF and get to Phoenicia than just flying into the city and taking the bus or car pooling upstate.
